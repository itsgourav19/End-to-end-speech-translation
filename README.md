# End-to-end-speech-translation
<h5> The code for a novel method of translating voice from one language to another without the need for intermediary text transcriptions in the latent space is contained in this repository. Our approach, which makes use of generative models, provides a smooth and precise translation experience.</h5>
 **Summary:**
Conventional voice translation systems usually require more than one stage, such as text translation once audio is converted to text using speech recognition. But every step along the way, this method introduces mistakes and constraints. By translating voice to speech directly, our approach aims to get around these problems and enable more precise and effective translation.
